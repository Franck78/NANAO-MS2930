MS2930 schematic


This is work in progress documentation and schematic for this nanao board.

For some reason, there is no existing 'nanao official' schematic for it.


There is no real documentation yet. I added some oscilloscopes from
strategic points.

A good documentation should be 

-setup guide (all the pots and in witch order)

-trouble shooting guide

-description of every sub-systems: this can easily be added  now,
  so if you see something important to say or wrong, tell it.
  


There is probably some errors remaining , particurlarly ceramic caps values.
If you have any dead board, fell free to remove and measure some of them !




A good thing to do with this drawing is to make it printable on A4 pages.



If you are earning money with repairing this chassis, don't forget me.

This was really a time consuming job.


Versions 

I put it here as RC3 with hope to get new fixes.
I'm currently with v5.1

When everything is ok, I will add the 'official' pdf with V1.0
Consider any other version as obsolete
